# Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.
# You should create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this.
# Author: Sean Elliott 

def sqrt(a):   
    num1 = (a ** 0.5) 
    print(num1)
    return (num1) 
a = float(input("Enter a positive integer:"))
print(sqrt)
#print("The square root of {} is approximately {}") 

#print("The square root of {} is approx. {} ")


#input("Please enter a positive number: ") 
#answer = sqrt
#print ("The square root of {} is approximately {}")
